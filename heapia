This script starts the Heapmanipulator's interactive interface.

The interface can be started by typing "./heapia". This should give a
Python shell. Type "h()" into this shell to get help.

The interface can be also used in a batch mode: give the commands to run
(Python expressions) as arguments of this script, e.g.:
    ./heapia 'dl()' 'g()'
END
else
    python heapia.py "$@"
