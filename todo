Implementation
--------------

* Subject parsing should be fixed: now the subject '[a]b[c]d' becomes subject
  'd' and tags ['a','c']
* Generator: options about the fields to generate (date, tags, etc.)
* There is encoding problem with mail '941'
* Tags and flags should be sets and not lists?
* devnotes.txt: developer notes
    * architecture (relation of Post, MailDB and PostSet)
    * performance improvement possibilities (iterators)
    * using wrappers to protect e.g. MailDB.posts()
    * terminology: previous, next, cause, consequence
* Generator: * instead of the same subjects; same with tags
    Attis: Something [heap]
      Josh: * [heap] [heap-conventions]
        Csabi: Something else [heap] [heap-conventions]
          Josh: * [heap] [heap-conventions]
* Tags: "tag implies tag" relations
* Flag: New-thead flag to indicate that the email begins a new thread.
  Post.inreplyto -> new-thread flag (stub)
  Post.real_inreplyto
* Console interface
* Actor
* Search
* Downloading emails since given date.
* Generator: it should be able to determine the width of the generated HTML
  page (to discuss)
* Improve CSS
* Cleanup functionality
