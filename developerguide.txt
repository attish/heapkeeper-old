HEAPMANIPULATOR DEVELOPER GUIDE

This file is a high-level introduction to the Heapmanipulator program (or
Manipulator for short) for the developer's eyes. More specific details can be
found in the documentation inside the Python code. Thanks to Python's help system,
the documentation can be accessed without opening the source code.


FILES

There are text files that contain information about the Manipulator:
    README: This is for new users.
    todo.txt: Our feature and bug tracking "system".
    userguide.txt: User Guide.
    developerguide.txt: Developer Guide.

The Manipulator consists of Python modules.

    heapmanip: The database and business logic of the Manipulator. It
        implements Post, MailDB, PostSet and Generator, which are the most
        important classes of the program.
    heapia: The interactive interface of the Manipulator.

We use unit tests to test the Manipulator's code. Each module has a module that
tests it.

    test_heapmanip: Tests the heapmanip module.
    test_heapia: Tests the heapia module.
    test: Tests all modules.

There is also a CSS file for the generated HTML files:

    heapindex.css
