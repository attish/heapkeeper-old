Development
===========

This file is a high-level introduction to the Heapkeeper program (or Hk for
short) for the developer's eyes. More specific details can be found in the
documentation inside the Python code. Thanks to Python's help system, the
documentation can be accessed without opening the source code.

Development method

Development tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the development tools we use are free and open source programs.

The following programs should be installed on a developer's computer: Python_,
Git_, Sphinx_ and reStructuredText_.

Python
""""""

Python_ is the interpreter that executes Heapkeeper. Heapkeeper needs Python
2.5 or 2.6.

.. _`Python`: http://www.python.org/

Git
"""

Git_ is version control system that we use to manage the source code and
documentation of Heapkeeper. These are stored in the `Heapkeeper repository`_,
which is hosted by GitHub_. We use Git 1.6, but probably previous versions are
probably fine. 

.. _`Git`: http://git-scm.com/
.. _`GitHub`: http://github.com/
.. _`Heapkeeper repository`: http://github.com/hcs42/heapkeeper/

Sphinx
""""""

The documentation is written in reStructuredText_ format and is generated by
the Sphinx_ program. We use Sphinx 0.6. The developers should also install
Pygments_, which is used by Sphinx to syntax highlight the Python code in the
documentation. Version 0.8 is enough.

The format defined by reStructuredText_ and Sphinx_ are not trivial. Two pages
that are worth to have a look at:

* `Sphinx documentation`_
* `reStructuredText Quick Reference`_

.. _`reStructuredText`: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html  
.. _`reStructuredText Quick Reference`:
   http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html
.. _`Sphinx`: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/
.. _`Sphinx documentation`: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html
.. _`Pygments`: http://pygments.org/

Communication
-------------

We use a heap to communicate. The development heap will become public when
we feel that Heapkeeper is in a stage to support maintaining a public heap.
Until then, you can contact us via email as described on the
`index page <index>`.

The :doc:`todo` file is our "bug and feature tracking" system that we use to
track the bugs we find and features that we want to implement.

Directory structure
-------------------

The main directories and files in the Heapkeeper's repository:

``README``
  Usual README file.
``doc``
  Documentation files. The ``rst`` files are text files with wiki-like syntax,
  and Sphinx can be used to generate HTML or other output from them.
``doc/todo.rst``
   Our feature and bug tracking "system".
``*.py``
   Python source files -- Heapkeeper itself
``heapindex.css``
   A CSS file for the generated HTML files.
