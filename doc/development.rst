Development
===========

This page describes the development methods and the tools that are used.

Development method
------------------

There are some rules to follow when developing Heapkeeper.
These are described in the :doc:`developmentrules`.
About more specific conventions regarding the documentation and the source
code, see :doc:`codingconventions`.

Reading
^^^^^^^

* `Producing Open Source Software -- How to Run a Successful Free
  Software Project by Karl Fogel`__: A book that gives a lot of practical
  advice to the kinds of projects we are.
* `The Elements of Style by William Strunk, Jr.`__: A book that helps write
  in good English style.

Development tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the development tools we use are free and open source programs.

The following programs should be installed on a developer's computer: Python_,
Git_, Sphinx_ and reStructuredText_.

Python
""""""

Python_ is the interpreter that executes Heapkeeper. Heapkeeper needs Python
2.5 or 2.6.

.. _`Python`: http://www.python.org/

Git
"""

Git_ is version control system that we use to manage the source code and
documentation of Heapkeeper. These are stored in the `Heapkeeper repository`_,
which is hosted by GitHub_. We use Git 1.6, but probably previous versions are
probably fine.

.. _`Git`: http://git-scm.com/
.. _`GitHub`: http://github.com/
.. _`Heapkeeper repository`: http://github.com/hcs42/heapkeeper/

Sphinx
""""""

The documentation is written in reStructuredText_ format and is generated by
the Sphinx_ program.

We currently use Sphinx 0.6.5. Unix users can install it with `easy_install`_:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ sudo easy_install 'sphinx==0.6.5'

The format defined by reStructuredText_ and Sphinx_ is not trivial. Two pages
that are worth to have a look at:

* `Sphinx documentation`_
* `reStructuredText Quick Reference`_

.. _`reStructuredText`: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
.. _`Sphinx`: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/
.. _`easy_install`: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
.. _`Mercurial`: http://mercurial.selenic.com/
.. _`Sphinx repository`: http://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/
.. _`Sphinx documentation`: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html
.. _`reStructuredText Quick Reference`:
   http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html

Communication
-------------

We use a heap to communicate. The development heap will become public when
we feel that Heapkeeper is in a stage to support maintaining a public heap.
Until then, you can contact us via email as described on the
`index page <index>`.

The :doc:`todo` file is our "bug and feature tracking" system that we use to
track the bugs we find and features that we want to implement.

Content of the repository
-------------------------

The main directories and files in Heapkeeper's repository:

``README``
    Usual README file.
``doc``
    Documentation files. The ``rst`` files are text files with wiki-like
    syntax, and Sphinx can be used to generate HTML or other output from them.
``doc/todo.rst``
    Our feature and bug tracking "system". Will be replaced by the Heapkeeper
    heap.
``*.py``
    Python source files -- Heapkeeper itself
``heapindex.css``
    A CSS file for the generated HTML files.
