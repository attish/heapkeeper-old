Communication (Heapkeeper Heap)

We use a heap to communicate. That heap is called the Heapkeeper Heap. The
e-mail address of the traditional mailing list behind it is
:email:`heapkeeper-heap@googlegroups.com`, so send an email to this address if
you want to send a post to the Heapkeeper Heap. The post database of Heapkeeper
Heap can be accessed here__. The generated HTML pages can be viewed here__.
