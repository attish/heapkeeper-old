User experience

* If the body of a post is copied from the HTML page and pasted somewhere,
  the result is exactly the body of the post as stored in the mail file.
* The static HTML file generated from a post, from a thread or from an index
  depends only on the mail database. It does not depend on what other posts,
  threads or indices are generated and how.
