User experience
"""""""""""""""

* If the body of a post is copied from the HTML page and pasted somewhere,
  the result is exactly the body of the post as stored in the mail file.
* The static HTML file generated from the post database depends only on the
  generator, the options it received and the post database. It does not depend
  on what other pages are generated and how.
