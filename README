What you need
-------------

You need to have Python. I have Python 2.5.

Initial settings
----------------

Create the following 4 files: username, pw, host, post.
Each should contain one line with the specific setting.
    
Execution
---------

Just type:
$ ./heap.py
or
$ python heap.py

You will see something like this:
$ ./heap.py
Downloading mail #1
Downloading mail #2
Downloading mail #3
Downloading mail #4
Downloading mail #5
Downloading mail #6
Downloading mail #7
Downloading mail #8

The program created a directory called "mail" and downloaded the 8 messages
there.
$ ls mail
1.mail  2.mail  3.mail  4.mail  5.mail  6.mail  7.mail  8.mail
