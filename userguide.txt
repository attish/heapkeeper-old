Heapmanipulator User Guide
--------------------------

Heap is a data structure that consists of posts. It is primarily represented in
mailfiles, but HTML files can be generated from them. The posts have fields,
e.g. author, subject, tags, flags, a field that describes the previous post.
The generated HTML can show the posts in a threaded structure.

The Heapmanipulator is a program written is Python that can manipulate this
data structure: e.g. it can download new posts from an IMAP server, modify the
posts, and generate HTML files.

The Heapmanipulator consists of several modules that are described in the
Developer guide.
